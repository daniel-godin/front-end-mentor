# README for Blog Preview Card Challenge

This is my first front end mentor challenge that I used React with.  

Here are the things that I learned:

- I learned how to import files from the assets folder that I downloaded with the challenge.  Including:  Fonts, Images, & Favicons.
- I learned how to make a simple component "Card()", and implemented that into the default "BlogPreviewCard" React Component for the challenge.

Things I want to learn next:

- React Router.  So I can dynamically route to each challenge from a main home page.
- React Props.
